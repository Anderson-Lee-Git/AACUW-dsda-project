# AACUW Project

## Target Group
We would like to pitch this project idea to those members interested in exploring topics of data science, analytics, visualization, and machine learning. We want to include all members with varying degrees of experience and provide a learning opportunity as well as a final product. This will be an opportunity open to all members of the AACUW, including members of different class standings (freshmen to seniors). This is also open to members of varying experience, including those with little to no coding experience. 

## Objective
Throughout this project, we will learn and practice data analytical skills, data visualization techniques, and machine learning. This will be learned through the Python programming language, particularly data programming of Python. Ultimately, the participants of this project will engage with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizing skills. This will include formulating a final product in practicing the mentioned skills from a large-scale dataset. Participants will benefit from technical abilities as well as projects for resume or career-related exhibitions.

### Summarize skills learned
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Python Programming
- Basic Application of Machine learning

## Description

### Phase 1 - Preparation
We will be including 3 - 5 weeks of weekly workshops and lessons to prepare you for the second stage. The content we’ll be covering starts from basic python programming, including basic syntax, variables, data types, functions, and a few data structures. It’s expected to have some practice problems in between the workshops. We believe those will be extremely helpful while learning python. After you learn and master the above basics in python, we’ll move on to essential usages of libraries such as sklearn, numpy, pandas, and so on. Finally, we’ll take a smaller dataset to apply what we learned from this stage and see how we can expand the scale from this dataset to the next stage. 

### Phase 2 - Application in Dataset
After your preparation from phase 1 or you just join us with the required skills, you will join a team of 5 to 6 people led by an experienced mentor. Each team will participate in a Kaggle competition for around 6 weeks. Although the task and experiences you will take vary from team to team, you can expect to learn and apply knowledge to a large-scale dataset, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. The outcome will be judged by the competition with quantifiable results. In the end, you will be able to extend the same module and project life-cycle you would have in this project to your personal project and ideas!
